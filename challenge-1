/**************
* coding challenge 1
* Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI(body mass index),which is calculated using the formula : BMI = mass / height ^ 2 = mass / (height * height)
* (mass in kg and height in meter)
* 1.store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
* 2.calculate both their BMIs
* 3.create a boolean variable containing information about whether a Mark has a higher BMI than John.
* 4,print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3(something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true ").
*/

//Answer:

var markHeight = 1.5; //meter
var johnHeight = 1.6; //meter
var markMass = 55; //kg
var johnMass = 57; //kg
var markBmi = markMass / (markHeight * markHeight );
var johnBmi = johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight );
var bmi = markBmi > johnBmi ;
console.log('Is Mark\'s BMI higher than John\'s ? '+ ' ' + bmi);
console.log(johnBmi);
console.log(markBmi);
