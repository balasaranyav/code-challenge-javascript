 //Answer:
 
var johnScoreAvg = (89 + 120 + 103) / 3 ;
console.log('john team score : '+ johnScoreAvg);  

var mikeScoreAvg = (116 + 94 + 123) / 3 ;
console.log('Mike team score : '+ mikeScoreAvg);

var maryScoreAvg = (97 + 134 + 105) / 3;
console.log ('Mary team score : '+ maryScoreAvg);

if(johnScoreAvg > mikeScoreAvg && johnScoreAvg > maryScoreAvg) {
    console.log('John team wins the match');
} else if(mikeScoreAvg > johnScoreAvg && mikeScoreAvg > maryScoreAvg) {
    console.log('Mike team wins the match');
} else if(maryScoreAvg > johnScoreAvg && maryScoreAvg >mikeScoreAvg) {
    console.log('Mary team wins the match');
} else {
    console.log('Match draw');
}
